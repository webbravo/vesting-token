# Staking/vesting contract that interacts with a UI/Frontend

## Users can stake some of their tokens. When users stake their tokens, they are effectively locked and can't be transferred or spent.

- Create a function modifyTokenBuyPrice and restrict access only to the owner.

- Create a function buyToken that can be called publicly to buy/mint new tokens.

- Created a basic User Interface that makes use of ethers.js to interact with the smart contract.
